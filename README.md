# Generating tip calibrations from the PaleobioDB
This function, `generate_calibrations`, takes as input a CSV file (`input_file`) containing data related to taxa, the most recent occurence (`min_ma`), and oldest occurence (`max_ma`). It then performs several operations to process this data and generate calibration information for each taxa in a specific format, saving the result in a text file (`output_file`). The input file must be formatted properly, similar to the 'data_example' file.
